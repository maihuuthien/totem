## Basic info

I'm a software engineer from Vietnam. My full name is Mai Huu Thien, but you can call me just Thien.
I was born in Ho Chi Minh city and had lived there almost my whole life, but I moved to Ha Noi since 2021, where I got married to my wife, and witnessed the birth of our son in 2023.
My favorite musician is Sondre Lerche. My favorite TV show is "How I Met Your Mother" (I'm totally a Ted Mosby!).
I own a Lego collection (mostly Lego Technic), which I intend to pass down to my son one day, although right now he's more interested in Hot Wheels.


## Things most people don't know about me

I used to be an extreme introvert. (Maybe I still am, just better at hiding it.)
One introverted characteristic I possess is that I tend to think in written language, which makes my verbal communication sound weird.
It took me quite a while to dial down this talking style to be able to fit in. However, if you ever get to really know me, you might hear me telling stories like this:

A few years ago, I was on an island for over two months, isolated from the COVID outbreak on the mainland. On the island, every night I walked past this house. Never seen anyone there at night, yet every time I felt like the house was calling me to step in. Until one night, I actually did.
And it was the scariest place I had ever been to. Looks like people were using it as a storage house. There were many unused beds. Every two beds were stacked up, with white sheet draped down on them. Under the green light of the exit signs, the only light besides my phone's, those white bed sheets became even more surreal.
While I walked into the middle of the maze created by those bed blocks, I felt like I was going to see someone at every turn. To calm myself down, I started whispering, as silently, yet persistently as a train of thought, "I am the ghost in this house. I am the ghost in this house..."

Every now and then, I still see myself trying to find the same darkness, walk into it, bathe myself in all its embracing nature, whispering again that same mantra, as if it has become the soundtrack of my life. Eventually, we are all ghosts in this house. The ghost of yesterday, been and gone.
